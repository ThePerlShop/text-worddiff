Name
    Text::WordDiff - Track changes between documents

Synopsis
        use Text::WordDiff;

        my $diff = word_diff 'file1.txt', 'file2.txt', { STYLE => 'HTML' };
        my $diff = word_diff \$string1,   \$string2,   { STYLE => 'ANSIColor' };
        my $diff = word_diff \*FH1,       \*FH2;       \%options;
        my $diff = word_diff \&reader1,   \&reader2;
        my $diff = word_diff \@records1,  \@records2;

        # May also mix input types:
        my $diff = word_diff \@records1,  'file_B.txt';

Description
    This module is a variation on the lovely Text::Diff module. Rather than
    generating traditional line-oriented diffs, however, it instead
    generates word-oriented diffs. This can be useful for tracking changes
    in narrative documents or documents with very long lines. To diff source
    code, one is still best off using Text::Diff. But if you want to see how
    a short story changed from one version to the next, this module will do
    the job very nicely.
